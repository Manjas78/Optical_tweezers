## Practical Applications

> A fiber based optical trapping system, namely inclined dual fiber optical tweezers, that can simultaneously apply and measure forces both in water and in a 3D polyacrylamide gel matrix is developed.

## Theory and Working Principle

$$E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4$$

With mass $m$ equal zero this reduces to $p = \frac{E}{c}$ where $E$ is the photon energy $E_{Ph} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$.
Hence one can obtain the impulse $p$ of a single photon in terms of its wavelength by $p(\lambda) = \frac{h}{\lambda}$.
The impulse of a photon emitted by a diode laser is $p = \frac{h}{980 \times 10^{-9} m} \approx 6.8e-28\,kg\,m\,s^{-1}$.
